# Login Process with JWT in React-Express Application

This is an example implementation of the login process using JSON Web Token (JWT) in a split application between frontend using React and backend using Express.

## Description

This application demonstrates how to perform login process using JWT for user authentication. The login process involves a frontend built with React and a backend built with Express. Upon successful login, users will receive a JWT token which will be stored on the client-side (browser) and used to authorize requests to the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: As the frontend framework for building responsive and interactive user interfaces.
- **Express**: As the backend framework for handling HTTP requests from the client application and providing APIs for authentication and authorization processes.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: To generate authentication tokens which will be used to authorize requests to the backend.
- **bcryptjs**: To encrypt and verify user passwords stored in the database.
- **Axios**: To make HTTP requests from the React application to the Express backend.

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Development Environment Setup**

   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Backend Setup (Express)**

   - Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory.
   - Install all dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
   - Create a `.env` file to store sensitive configurations such as JWT secret key.
   - Create a `.env` file containing the following information:
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
     ```
   - Start the backend server by running the command `npm start`.
3. **Frontend Setup (React)**

   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.
   - Install all dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
   - Run the frontend application with the command `npm start`.
4. **Testing the Application**

   - Open a browser and access the React application running at `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Try the login process using valid username and password.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to secure the generated JWT tokens by implementing appropriate security practices, such as setting token expiration time, securely storing tokens in local storage, and guarding against CSRF attacks.
- Don't forget to encrypt user passwords before storing them in the database using hash algorithms like bcrypt.
- Always perform input validation from users both on the client-side and server-side to prevent XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
